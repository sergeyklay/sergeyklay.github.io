__Hello__

My name is Serghei Iakovlev, and you're looking at the 4th reincarnation of my
web presence. I use this blog to share ideas and code snippets using my favorite
languages: Haskell, Common Lisp, Ruby.

[My GPG public key.][gpg-key]

I'm a programmer. I'm mostly focused on building API's, HTTP-related
applications and improving development processes.

I'm part of [Phalcon Framework][phalcon], full-stack PHP framework
delivered as a C-extension. I'm [Codeception][codecept] team member. I'm
currently working at [PDFfiller][pdffiller], a comprehensive online document
management platform that provides the services of an online editor, cloud
storage platform, and a signature request manager all in one package.

When I'm not working, I'm enjoying watch documentaries, science fiction movies
and sometimes play Mahjong or Go.

I'm available for [consulting][consulting] as well.

I love open source, Haskell, Common Lisp, Ruby and live in Emacs on Linux/macOS.
