# Serghei's blog

You're looking at the source code of my brand-spanking new blog.
Feel free to fork and mess around with it.

You can adapt it to your own needs or improve it if you want.

## How to try it out

First you need to get the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:sergeyklay/sergeyklay.github.io.git
cd sergeyklay.github.io.git
```

After that, we need a few ruby dependencies:

```
gem install jekyll
gem install github-pages
```

Then, from the root of the blog just run:

```
jekyll serve --watch
```

This will typically start a server on port 4000.
